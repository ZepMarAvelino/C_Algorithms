# C_Algotithms
Algorithms made in C

## Purpose
To provide pure C algorithm libraries, aimed to simplify the development of future projects.

## Algorithms included

### Radix Sort
Radix sort library using the LSD method. This library can perform sorting of int, float, and long long. The float sorting is done by multiplying the float by 10^5 and then casting to a long long.
This sort is an ascending sort, which can be really quick and effective for integers.

### Merge Sort

### Insertion Sort

### Selection Sort

### Bubble Sort

### Quicksort

## Future modifications

 - Inclusion of:
	- Quicksort - Ternary
	- Heapsort
	- Tree sort
	- Timsort
	- Counting Sort

 - Attempt multi-threaded divide and conquer algorithms
